# ⚡ LeadMind: The Autonomous Multi-Agent Sales Engine

**LeadMind** is a state-of-the-art Sales Development Representative (SDR) automation platform. It leverages a sophisticated **Multi-Agent Architecture** to bridge the gap between high-scale automation and deep, human-like personalization.

By combining real-time behavioral tracking with autonomous AI research agents, LeadMind identifies high-intent prospects and engages them with hyper-personalized outreach exactly when they are most likely to convert.

## 🛠️ System Architecture
The core of LeadMind is built on **LangGraph**, orchestrating a sequence of specialized AI agents that process leads through a neural pipeline. The system maintains a persistent "State" object that matures as each agent enriches the lead profile.

## 🔍 Detailed Lead Intelligence & Outreach Channels

### 🧬 Identity, Enrichment & Intent Analytics
The LeadMind enrichment wing automatically identifies the prospect's company size, industry, and exact office region. It simultaneously processes real-time tracking signals—such as email opens and link clicks—to build a multi-dimensional picture of the prospect's receptivity.

### ✍️ AI Content Drafting, Web Scraping & Strategic Follow-up Timers
Our drafting agents perform deep web-scrapes of company domains to extract specific product contexts and USPs. This data is injected into hyper-personalized email drafts, while autonomous "Timing Engines" manage strategic follow-up intervals to ensure your messages hit the inbox at peak engagement hours.

### 📞 AI Voice & Virtual Call Assistant
When a lead hits a critical "Hot" threshold, the system can trigger an AI-driven Voice Assistant to execute automated follow-up calls or personalized voice-mail drops, bridging the gap between digital and verbal engagement.

### 📝 CRM Performance Audit & Logger
Ensuring 100% transparency. The `AGN_CRM` agent maintains a rigorous audit trail of every status transition, communication event, and AI-generated draft, keeping your core database perfectly in sync with your team's workflow.

### 📊 Behavioral SDK & Visitor Profiling
The LeadMind SDK provides the "Digital DNA" of your visitors. It tracks deep engagement metrics including **Visitor Behavioral Profiles**, **Intent Score (e.g., 65/100)**, **Total Pages Viewed**, **Dwell Time**, and **Max Scroll Depth**—allowing you to distinguish casual browsers from active buyers.

## 🔄 The Pipeline Workflow

### Multi-Channel Kanban Pipeline
A visual deals board that manages the lifecycle of a lead. The AI automatically transitions prospects through custom stages (New Lead -> Dispatched -> Meeting Booked) based on engagement signals captured by the SDK and tracking pixel.

### High-Fidelity Multi-Channel Designer
Create and test dynamic templates that adapt their content fragments based on the AI's research. Preview exactly how your personalization will appear across Email, SMS, and LinkedIn.

### Strategic Task Board
For complex leads requiring a "Human Touch," the system automatically generates high-priority manual tasks. This ensures your human SDRs spend their time on high-leverage closing activities rather than data entry.
